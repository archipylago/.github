# archipylago
_Your friendly neighbourhood Python community in Turku_

Hello there and welcome to our GitHub organization! We are a developer community of Python enthusiasts from Turku, Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®.

Our first events are expected to start in early 2024. To stay up to date with updates, register at [Meetabit](https://meetabit.com/communities/archipylago) and you'll be the first one to hear when things happen.

More information will follow soon!

(PS. the name is a combination of archipelago and Python and the credit for this wonderful name goes to [forbidden-arts](https://github.com/forbidden-arts))
